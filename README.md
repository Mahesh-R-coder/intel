Story book narrative model

--This model can able to generate it's own story and images 
--we are accessing pretrained models to this project like (Gemini)
-- And  leverage the model by using of intel openvino toolkit for optimize the rendering time
-- you can't directly access the model because you need the access token key from hugging face.


Technnologies that we are used :
  LLM:
    The LLM basically narrte the story from the online of prompt

  Stable diffusion:
    It will generate the images with the help of prompt that is produced by the LLM

  SQL:
    We also having the login page.the user datas are going to story into the local database


  Fine Tuning:
    ! For fine tuning we are using LORA (low rank adaptatioin) which is basically freeze the base parameters and  use the lora weights
